# react-shadowed-double-scrollbar

A simple library for adding scrollbars on both top and bottom of content with customizable shadows.

Standalone fork of https://github.com/umchee/react-double-scrollbar. Fully rewritten in functional style, with the addition of shadows to make it clearer to users if an element can be scrolled (particularly useful for mobile browsers where scrollbars are hidden by default).
